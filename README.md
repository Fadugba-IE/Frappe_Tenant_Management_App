## Tenant Management System

This is a tenant Management App developed with Frappe Framework.The whole idea is to create an application that will be used by Agents to Manage their Properties, Owners, Agreements and Payment transactions.

A dedicated user was created for an Agent and the Agent can Log in with the credentials creastd. Multiple users can be created and assigned different roles on the system.

5 Doctypes were crreated namely: Property, Owner, Tenant, Tenancy Agreement and Payment Transsaction
These doctypes capture the information of Owners, Tenants and properties and they were linked. i.e a owner is linked with his property. A tenant can be registered to a property and so on.

A report was created for Rent payment and was linked to the payment transaction Doctype.
